# Terminator Project Overview

## What is Terminator?
Terminator is a Playwright-style SDK for automating Windows GUI applications, designed specifically for AI agents. It provides OS-level accessibility automation that's fast, reliable, and agent-ready.

## Key Features
- 🪟 Built for Windows, works on macOS (partial support)
- 🧠 Designed for AI agents, not humans
- ⚡ Uses OS-level accessibility APIs (not vision-based)
- 🧩 Multi-language support: TypeScript, Python, and Rust
- 📈 80ms UI scans with 10000x speedup via compiled workflows

## Project Structure

### Core Components
- **[terminator/](mdc:terminator)** - Main Rust library with core automation logic
- **[bindings/](mdc:bindings)** - Language bindings directory
  - **[bindings/nodejs/](mdc:bindings/nodejs)** - TypeScript/Node.js bindings
  - **[bindings/python/](mdc:bindings/python)** - Python bindings
- **[examples/](mdc:examples)** - Example implementations and demos
- **[terminator-workflow-recorder/](mdc:terminator-workflow-recorder)** - Workflow recording tool

### Configuration Files
- **[Cargo.toml](mdc:Cargo.toml)** - Workspace configuration with all members
- **[README.md](mdc:README.md)** - Project documentation and quick start

## Core Concepts

### Desktop Automation
The main entry point is through a `Desktop` class that provides:
- Application launching (`open_application`)
- Element location (`locator`) 
- UI interaction (click, type, etc.)

### Locators
Elements are found using accessibility properties like:
- `name:ElementName` - Find by accessible name
- Other accessibility attributes

### Multi-Platform Support
- **Windows**: Full support using UIAutomation
- **Linux**: Partial support  
- **macOS**: Partial support using accessibility APIs

## Development Workflow
This is a Rust workspace with multiple crates. The core library is in `terminator/` and language bindings are generated in `bindings/`. Examples demonstrate usage patterns for different scenarios.

## AI Agent Integration
Terminator is specifically designed for AI agents to automate desktop applications programmatically, making it ideal for workflow automation and testing scenarios.
