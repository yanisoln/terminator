# Terminator MCP Agent

This directory contains the Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent that allows AI assistants (like Cursor) to interact with your desktop using the Terminator UI automation library.

MCP is useful to test out the `terminator` lib and see what you can do. You can use any model.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js:** You need Node.js installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Git:** You need Git installed. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3.  **Running Terminator Server:** The main Terminator server must be running. Follow the steps in the main project [Quick Start guide](../README.md#quick-start) (steps 1-3) to clone the repo, download the server, and run it. **Leave the server running in its terminal.**

## Installation & Setup

Open a new terminal (like PowerShell or Command Prompt) **separate from the one running the Terminator server**:

1.  **Navigate to the MCP directory:**
    If you haven't already, clone the repository and change to the `mcp` directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator
    cd terminator/mcp
    ```
    If you already cloned it, just navigate to the `mcp` sub-directory within your `terminator` folder.

2.  **Install dependencies and build the agent:**
    ```bash
    npm install && npm run build
    ```
    *(This assumes a `build` script exists in `package.json`. If it fails, check `package.json` for the correct build command, e.g., `tsc`).*

3.  **Configure Cursor:**
    You need to tell Cursor how to run this agent. Create a file named `mcp.json` in your Cursor configuration directory (`%USERPROFILE%\.cursor` on Windows, `~/.cursor` on macOS/Linux).

    You can use this PowerShell command **while inside the `mcp` directory** to generate the correct JSON content:

    ```powershell
    # Run this command inside the terminator/mcp directory
    $mcpPath = ($pwd).Path.Replace('\', '\\') + '\\dist\\index.js'
    $jsonContent = @"
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "terminator-mcp-agent": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
          "$mcpPath"
      ]
    }
  }
}
"@
    Write-Host "--- Copy the JSON below and save it as mcp.json in your %USERPROFILE%\.cursor directory ---"
    Write-Host $jsonContent
    Write-Host "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
    # Optional: Try to automatically open the directory
    Start-Process "$env:USERPROFILE\.cursor" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    ```

    *   Run the PowerShell command above.
    *   Copy the JSON output (starting with `{` and ending with `}`).
    *   Create the `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor` directory if it doesn't exist.
    *   Create a new file named `mcp.json` inside that directory.
    *   Paste the copied JSON content into `mcp.json` and save it.

## Running

1.  Ensure the main Terminator server (e.g., `server.exe`) is still running (from the Prerequisites step).
2.  Restart Cursor if it was already running.
3.  Cursor should now automatically detect and use the `terminator-mcp-agent` when you invoke its capabilities. You don't need to manually run the `node dist/index.js` command; Cursor handles it based on the `mcp.json` configuration.
